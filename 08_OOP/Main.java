		Nella OOP Object Oriented Programming abbiamo:

		Inheritance:
			Vehicle -> Car -> sport/normal
			Parent-Child relationship
			!!!	represents IS-A relationship !!! (sport car is a car. a car is a vehicle.)
			It is used for
				method overriding (to achieve run-time polymorphism)
				Code reusability
			syntax:
				class SubClass extends SuperClass{ ... }
			the subclass will inherite the superclass methods, classVariables (see DemoInheritance)
			Levels of inheritance:
			      single: A->B
			hierarchical: A->B A->C
			  multilevel: A->B->C


		Polymorphism: static && dynamics

		static: ovveride methods
		dynamic: the object type is chose at runtime (Vehicle bmw = new Car();) bmw will call Car.methods if invoked!
